Our patient response times have dropped dramatically, and patients actually appreciate how fast and accurate the medical information is. The system also frees up our medical staff to focus on complex patient care instead of answering the same appointment and billing questions over and over again. It feels like we added an extra team member without the cost, and the HIPAA compliance gives us peace of mind.",
