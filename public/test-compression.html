        <div class="info">
            <strong>Instructions:</strong> Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12), go to the Network tab, refresh this page, and check if the response headers show "Content-Encoding: gzip".
        </div>

        <h2>How to Check:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Press F12 to open Developer Tools</li>
            <li>Go to the Network tab</li>
            <li>Refresh this page</li>
            <li>Click on the HTML file in the network list</li>
            <li>Check the Response Headers section</li>
            <li>Look for "Content-Encoding: gzip"</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Expected Results:</h2>
        <div class="success">
            ✅ <strong>Success:</strong> If you see "Content-Encoding: gzip" in the response headers, compression is working!
        </div>
        
        <div class="error">
            ❌ <strong>No Compression:</strong> If you don't see "Content-Encoding: gzip", compression is not working.
        </div>

        <h2>Common Issues & Solutions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server doesn't support mod_deflate:</strong> Contact your hosting provider</li>
            <li><strong>Files are too small:</strong> Compression only works on files above a certain size</li>
            <li><strong>Browser caching:</strong> Clear browser cache and try again</li>
            <li><strong>CDN interference:</strong> Check if you're using a CDN that might be interfering</li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Note:</strong> Gzip compression typically only works on files larger than 1-2KB. Very small files may not show compression even when it's enabled.
